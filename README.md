Brasouverts   
======

Brasouverts is a non-profit organization that distributes food and clothes for people in the area of Vallauris, France. A lot of immigrants, old people and SDFs (french for "person without a fixed residenceÂ¨) benefit from the distributions. 

This is a simple rails webapp that runs on "instant rails" (http://instantrails.rubyforge.org/) and is used to record who gets what, and when. To regularly receive the goods we distribute, you have to bring proof of need and we need to keep track of that, since part of what we distribute comes from the French National Food Bank (http://www.banquealimentaire.org/).
